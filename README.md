## Applications

Edge AI is an amazing field, with exponential potential — here are eight high‑impact application areas presented in the style you asked for:

- **Computer Vision at the Edge** – Real‑time object detection, pose‑estimation and defect‑inspection on cameras, drones and factory lines using TensorFlow Lite, OpenVINO™ and NVIDIA TensorRT, so raw video never leaves the device.
- **Voice & Audio Processing** – Always‑on wake‑word spotting, speech recognition and noise‑cancellation running locally on smart speakers, earbuds and intercoms with frameworks like Qualcomm® SAI, Amazon Alexa™ Voice Service (AVS) Edge and PyTorch Mobile.
- **Predictive Maintenance** – TinyML models on microcontrollers analyze vibration, acoustic and current‑draw signatures from pumps, motors and HVAC gear to flag anomalies seconds after they appear, slashing unplanned downtime.
- **Healthcare & Wearables** – On‑device ECG arrhythmia classification, SpO₂ trend analysis and fall detection in smartwatches, patches and hearing aids, preserving privacy and extending battery life by avoiding constant cloud uploads.
- **Smart Retail & Checkout‑Free Stores** – Shelf cameras and weight sensors use local CNNs to track what shoppers pick up and return, enabling “walk‑out” payment while keeping customer video on‑prem for GDPR compliance.
- **Autonomous Mobile Robots & Drones** – Sensor fusion, SLAM and path‑planning networks run on embedded GPUs / NPUs inside AMRs, warehouse bots and inspection UAVs, delivering sub‑50 ms reaction times even with spotty connectivity.
- **Smart Energy & Micro‑Grids** – Edge controllers forecast load, solar output and price signals in real time, dynamically balancing batteries, EV chargers and HVAC systems to cut peak demand and carbon footprint.
- **Precision Agriculture & Environmental Monitoring** – Field‑deployed sensors and ag‑drones execute plant‑disease and soil‑moisture classifiers on‑site, enabling targeted irrigation, fertilization and early pest intervention far from a data center.
