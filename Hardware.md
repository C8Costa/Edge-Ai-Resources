# ⚙️ Edge AI Hardware Overview

A categorized overview of available Edge AI hardware accelerators and development boards. Hardware is grouped into three main categories:

- **GPUs** and **FPGAs** – general-purpose accelerators for parallel workloads.  
- **ASICs/Custom Accelerators** – purpose-built silicon optimized for neural network inference.  

Focus is placed on stable products from reputable manufacturers to ensure long-term support and community ecosystem.
